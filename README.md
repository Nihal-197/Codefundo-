## Idea
### A general problem with elections is fake news that spread throughout the internet.

- We can use the  cryptographic techniques from blockchain to ensure that  each and every news comes from a trusted and reliable resource.

- So, voters would only come across the media that is stamped with a unique cryptographic identifier, which — when cross-referenced with immutable records on a blockchain — can prove beyond a doubt where the media originated. Media without an identifier would be considered less trustworthy.

- In this case, instituting a blockchain system for media verification would likely have to be undertaken at the media level. We can create our own dataset just for proving that this thing would work.
